Smart Traffic Light Control System

In modern life we have to face with many problems one of which is traffic congestion becoming more serious day after day. It is said that the high tome of vehicles, the scanty infrastructure and the irrational distribution of the development are main reasons for augmented traffic jam. 

Traffic has become a major concern in recent times due to the massive increase in the number of automobiles on the road. Expansion of roads and construction of flyovers too are unable to decrease the frequency of traffic jams at intersections. This calls for an effective traffic control and management system. 

Today’s traffic management system has no emphasis on live traffic scenario, which leads to inefficient traffic management systems. This project has been implemented by using the python software and it aims to prevent heavy traffic congestion. Moreover, for implementing this project Image processing technique is used. 

At first, film of a lane is captured by a camera. A web camera is placed in a traffic lane that will capture images of the road on which we want to control traffic. Then these images are efficiently processed to know the traffic density. According to the processed data from commands, the controller will send the command to the traffic LEDs to show particular time on the signal to manage traffic.
Object Recognition – The process of recognizing objects in videos and images is known as Object recognition. This computer vision technique enables the autonomous vehicles to classify and detect objects in real-time. There are many machine learning and deep learning algorithms for object detection and recognition, such as Support vector machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), You Only Look Once (YOLO) model etc. We have made use of YOLO technique and COCO dataset.
